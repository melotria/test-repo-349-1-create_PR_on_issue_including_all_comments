## Node.js

Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a web browser. It allows developers to use JavaScript to write command line tools and for server-side scripting to produce dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user's web browser. Node.js represents a "JavaScript everywhere" paradigm, unifying web application development around a single programming language, rather than different languages for server-side and client-side scripts.
